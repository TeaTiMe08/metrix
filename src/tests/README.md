# Metrix Tests

This folder contains test scripts for the Metrix project that focus on color combinations generation, bulk testing, and creating data for the [Metrix Gallery](https://joanroig.github.io/metrix-gallery/).

## Color Combination Scripts

### `main_export_combinations.py`

Generates a comprehensive JSON file (`color_combinations.json`) containing all possible color combinations from the CSS4 named colors. Each combination includes:

- Background color
- Text color
- Contrast ratio
- Relationship types (complementary, contrasting, shade, analogous, etc.)

This data serves as the foundation for the Metrix Gallery website, allowing users to browse and select color combinations.

### `main_bulk_generate.py`

Performs bulk generation of Metrix GIFs for multiple color combinations simultaneously using multi-threading. Features:

- Concurrent processing of color combinations
- Skips already generated combinations
- Thread-specific temporary directories
- Queue-based task distribution

The complete set of 20,761 GIFs can be found here: https://github.com/joanroig/metrix-gallery/tree/bca23c0d42466eae02b8828acc3a055ad889072d/assets/gifs

### `main_bulk_random_tests.py`

Generates random color combinations for testing purposes, allowing for experimentation with different color schemas. It only uses Metrix logic without external files.

This script is particularly valuable for:

- Analyzing which colors Metrix generates naturally through its algorithms
- Identifying color combinations that are less likely to be generated by the core logic
- Discovering potentially "impossible" combinations that never emerge from the standard generation process
- Evaluating the distribution and diversity of automatically generated color palettes
- Revealing biases or patterns in the color generation algorithms

The insights gained from these tests help in refining Metrix's color generation algorithms and ensuring a balanced representation of the color spectrum.

## Usage

These scripts are primarily for development and testing purposes. The generated data helps in:

1. Populating the Metrix Gallery with visual examples
2. Testing color contrast and compatibility
3. Validating the rendering of different color combinations

## Note

When running these scripts locally, ensure you have set up your environment correctly with the required dependencies and have placed your GitHub token in the `.github_token` file in the root directory if you use variables in the TEXT environment property.
